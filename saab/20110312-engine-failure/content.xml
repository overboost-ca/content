<picture-set title="1999 Saab 9-5: Engine Failure">

  <description>
  Our trusty old 9-5 died a honorable death. Full throttle in third gear,
  at very respectable 437K. Old age and three years of stage3 took their toll.

    Removing the engine throught the top, did not want to mess with the subframe.
    Used a load leveller to tilt the engine and pull it with the gearbox attached.

    The whole thing was surprisingly easy. Once the engine is out of the car, 
    the gearbox can be easily removed and a stand bolted on.

    A gaping hole where piston #2 used to be. The pin was strong enough to

    Most of the piston remains found in the oil pan. It made four holes in the
    block. Some bits lodged themselves in the balance shaft chamber.
