  <description>

  The pipe is located on top of the engine, secured by two screws with a 10 mm
  hex head.

    The cast aluminium throttle body inlet pipe has a rather poorly designed
    entry port at the point where it mates to the delivery pipe from the intercooler.
    The ridge is rough and uneven with its thickness ranging from 3 to 6 mm,
    which constitutes a noticeable restriction to the air flow.

    Porting the pipe is a well-known and simple modification. The goal is
    to smooth the ridge, thin down and polish the walls around the entry port,
    providing a better transition from the delivery pipe. You can use a Dremel
    or more traditional tools like a round file and sandpaper.
