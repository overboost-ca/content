<picture-set title="Saab NG900: Convertible Roll Bar">

  <description>
  <p>This is a removable 4-point safety bar custom made by a reputable local
  <a href="http://www.cscracing.com/">roll cage builder</a> to
  <a href="http://www.casc.on.ca/">CASC-OR</a> specifications.
  I had to have it made to participate in track days with the Saab Owners' Club of Canada
  and other events.</p>

    The bar took 25 feet of 1.75"x0.12" mild steel tubing to make.

    The rear supports bolt on to the torsion box, so the rear seat needs
    to be lowered.

    Side interior panels also need to be removed, although I'm looking
    for a way to modify them to fit with the bar.

    There's no room in the rear, but all the front space is infact, and the
    seats can be moved to the rearmost position if needed.

    The bar is built to be higher than the driver's head in the helmet.

    Perhaps some netting can turn the bar into a windscreen to reduce the
    noise on the highway.

    The main hoop of the bar is attached to the floor under the carpet.

    The bolt plates of the main hoop are shaped to follow the profile
    of the floor.

    The reinforcement plates under the car have a similar fancy profile.

    The bar fully clears the foldable roof, following it closely to be as
    wide and tall as possible for maximum protection.

    With the roof and windows up, the car looks completely stock, unless
    you come really close and peek inside.

    The bar on the ground. It's relatively easy to get in and out.

    The weight of the whole thing is 60 lbs.
