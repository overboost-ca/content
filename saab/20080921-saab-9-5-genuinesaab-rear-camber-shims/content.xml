  <description>
  <p>Rear camber shim installation on a 1999 Saab 9-5. The procedure is similar
  for 1994-1998 Saab 900 and 1999-2002 9-3.</p>
  <p>Many 9-5 owners face the problem of the rear camber getting out of spec.
  It's especially noticeable with lowered suspension, which increases the
  negative camber to -2° or more, with no factory provision to adjust
  it (the spec on the 9-5 is -1.1°±0.25° for the
  sport chassis).</p>
  <p>Luckily, <a href="http://genuinesaab.com/">Taliaferro Imports</a> make
  camber adjustment shims that fit all 9-5, NG900 and OG9-3, allowing to
  change the rear camber by up to 1.2°. My 9-5 had too much camber on
  the left side, and I used these shims to even things out.</p>

    fit the shims.
