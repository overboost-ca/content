    It includes a high flow air filter and a PPC gadget (a device to upload
    new software into the ECU). I've also ordered a set of spark plugs
    recommended for this upgrade.

    The high flow air filter. It looks rather skinny when compared to the stock
    one, as it's about 1/3 smaller in diameter.

    The PPC comes with a bunch of cables and a full page instruction on where
    the Speedparts sticker should go ;).

    Unfortunately, the PPC could not upgrade the software in my car. It was
    getting stuck at 0% progress, so I've been sent a second one.

    The new one (on the right) supports Trionic 8 in addition to Trionic 7.
    I wish that helped, but the new device had the same problem uploading
    the software ;).

    After four months of complaining to various parties and trying to find who's
    responsible, I finally received a third PPC with a newer version of software
    directly from BSR, and it worked!

    Finally, while waiting for the PPC problem to be solved, I installed 
    a <a href="#/content/saab/20040817-saab-9-5-sport-exhaust">Remus exhaust</a>,
    so I can claim I have a stage 2 upgrade now.
