    Just picked up the kit at Thornhill Saab,
    the muffler and the centre pipe are sitting in my trunk. The parts are
    stainless steel and powder coated.

    The whole thing on the ground. I've also got an almost new flex pipe
    from <a href="http://www.beaconmotors.com">Beacon Motors</a>, since mine
    needs a replacement badly.

    The tip is the same as on the Viggen. Polished stainless steel with
    "SAAB" letters on it. The muffler is actually made my Remus, Austria.

    The installation is very straightforward. Raise the car, undo the nuts
    on the flex pipe and seven hangers that hold the centre pipe and the muffler.
    Nothing exciting to shoot here.

    The rusty nuts are a major pain, as usual. Be prepared!

    This is how the old exhaust looked like. Functional but boring.
    My car needs a wash too.

    The new one looks and sounds much better. And besides, it has a lifetime
    warranty.
