    Unscrew the battery support. It's usually held by 2 to 4 small bolts
    (10 mm), and could be mounted straight or sideways.

    Undo the big nut in the middle. The engine might sag some more, make sure
    the jack is holding up. Remove the Torx index screw.

    Unbolt the mount from the frame. The front bolt is easy, the one in the
    rear is blocked by some wires and hoses - use a spanner to reach it.

  <picture name="20090503g.Removed.jpg" title="Removed" date="03.05.2009">
    Remove the mount. The engine may shift suddenly after the mount is lifted,
    watch your fingers!

    You can see the crack on the left side of the old mount. The new version is
    beefier, and has a provision for a third bolt used on later cars.

  <picture name="20090503i.New_mount.jpg" title="New mount" date="03.05.2009">
    Insert the new mount. You may need to pump the jack up some more and
    rock the engine back and forth to get the mount to seat properly.

    First, fit the Torx index screw to make sure the mount is positioned 
    correctly. Tighten the upper nut to 62 ft-lbs.

    Re-install the battery support, the battery itself, tighten the bracket
    and connect the leads.
