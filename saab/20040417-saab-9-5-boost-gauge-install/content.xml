<picture-set title="Saab 9-5: Boost Gauge">

  <description>
  <p>A turbocharged car without a boost gauge is no fun. It's not that you
  really need it, but knowing what's really happening with your engine
  helps a bit, and the pressure surges when you mash the pedal sure are
  entertaining.</p>
  <p>My car was among those unfortunate Saabs that came without a boost gauge
  (not that the standard one is very useful though), and I long wanted to fix
  that. Here's a detailed (maybe too detailed) description of the installation
  process. (And I did wash the engine a couple of days after performing
  this work ;)</p>
  <p>The measurements I'm getting from a 1999 Saab 9-5 2.3t with a low pressure
  turbo are: the vacuum is 18-20 Hg at idle, 15 Hg while driving, up to 24 Hg
  when coasting. With the stock engine the boost during the moderate
  acceleration settled around 5 psi, the highest I've seen at WOT is 9 psi.
  An ECU upgrade from BSR raised these numbers to 12-13 psi in second gear
  and 14-15 psi in third.</p>

    A Cyberdyne Ultragage boost/vacuum gauge kit (part #A213E061Y) bought
    on eBay. It contains a gauge, a sender, some tubing and other stuff.

    I know I could've gotten an analog gauge for half the price, but I'm a
    digital freak, I like numbers and precision ;).

    a signal wire for the gauge.

    Our primary points of interest today would be the intake manifold and the
    big fuse box. The engine is filthy, and I'm sorry for that. Should have
    done the spring cleaning first.

    I didn't get a pod for the gauge, and now I didn't want it dangling on its
    wires while I'm driving in search for one, so I cut the top of a plastic
    bottle.

    The wires are connected, and the gauge sticks surprisingly tight between
    the pillar and the dash. It should hold until I find a suitable pod
    (or so I thought... then ended up using this bottle top pod for several years).
