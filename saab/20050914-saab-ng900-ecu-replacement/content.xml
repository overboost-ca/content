    Before removing the ECU, disconnect the battery or pull the "Trionic" fuse
    (#28).
    Move the carpeting away.
    Unlock ECU harness by pulling the lever and unplug it. Undo a screw
    in the lower right corner. The ECU slides down.

    The new ECU plugs right in. After the installation, perform an
    adaptation run by doing a series
    of full throttle accelerations in high gear from 2000 to 4500 RPM.
    It helps if you can find a long road going uphill.
