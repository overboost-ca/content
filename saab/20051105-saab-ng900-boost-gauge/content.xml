    More screws around the fuses. Finally, a 10 mm bolt at the bottom,
    and the trim panel comes off.

    Removing the fuze box is not absolutely necessary, but it gives you more
    room to do the wiring. Three Torx T25 screws.

  <picture name="20051105j.Pipe.jpg" title="Pipe" date="05.11.2005">

  <picture name="20051105l.More_wires.jpg" title="More wires" date="05.11.2005">
    Connect a piece of wire to the ground nut under the dash. Connect another
    wire to the cigarette lighter fuse for a source of switched power. It is
    a good idea to have the battery disconnected prior to this.

  <picture name="20051105m.Dash.jpg" title="Dash" date="05.11.2005">
    Many 2"1/16 gauges will fit right in, but you will need to cut the plastic
    inside the headlight switch socket. I decided to pop the dashboard to
    attach the display from the rear. Follow
    <a href="#/content/saab/20051105-saab-ng900-dashboard-and-instrument-cluster">this 
    guide</a> for dashboard removal.

    lines.

  <picture name="20051105p.Test_run.jpg" title="Test run" date="05.11.2005">
    Connect the wires, double check everything and do a test run. After
    you start the car, you should see 15-16 Hg of vacuum at idle.

  <picture name="20051105q.Headlight_switch.jpg" title="Headlight switch" date="05.11.2005">
    The headlight switch will rest inside the dashboard set to the
    "headlights on" position. Saab DRLs run the headlights full on anyway, so
    it won't make much difference.

  <picture name="20051105r.Wrapped.jpg" title="Wrapped" date="05.11.2005">
    Wrap the switch into something so it doesn't rattle inside the dash.
